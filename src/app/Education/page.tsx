         <p>Hello! I am Areeb a 17-year-old web designer and developer with a creative flair for crafting visually appealing and functional websites. I completed my matriculation in 2023 with a 75% score and am currently in my second year of intermediate studies at Aisha Bawany College. In the same year I completed a Computer Information Technology (CIT) course certified by SDC Pakistan and I am now expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies as a Cloud Applied student at GIAIC. My academic journey reflects my passion for technology and my continuous drive to enhance my skills. I have hands on experience with Next.js and Tailwind CSS creating responsive user-friendly websites and am continuously exploring new technologies like TypeScript and Node.js to expand my skill set. Lets collaborate and bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
